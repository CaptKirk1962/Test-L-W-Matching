Life Minus Work — Reflection Quiz

A Streamlit app that runs a 15‑question self‑reflection quiz and generates a rich, personalized PDF. It supports free‑text answers, deep AI insights, score bars, a logo header, “Balancing Opportunity” for your lowest themes, and a tiny progress tracker at the end of the report.
Folder layout

repo-root/
├─ main/
│  ├─ app.py                  # the Streamlit app
│  ├─ questions.json          # 15 questions + weights
│  ├─ Life-Minus-Work-Logo.webp  (optional; or logo.png)
│  └─ logo.png                   (optional alternative)

    Put questions.json and your logo file in the main/ folder, right next to app.py.

1) Running locally
Prereqs

    Python 3.10+ recommended

Install & run

python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run main/app.py

Add your OpenAI key (optional, for AI insights)

Create an environment variable before you run:

macOS / Linux

export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-...your-key..."

Windows (PowerShell)

$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-...your-key..."

If no key is set, the app falls back to a simple non‑AI narrative.
2) Deploying on Streamlit Cloud

    Push your repo to GitHub with this structure (see above).
    In Streamlit Cloud: New app → pick your repo, set Main file to main/app.py.
    Go to Settings → Secrets and add:

    OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-...your-key..."

    Click Rerun.

If you want to switch models (e.g., gpt-5-nano ↔ gpt-4o-mini), edit OPENAI_MODEL near the top of app.py.
Logo

    Place Life-Minus-Work-Logo.webp or logo.png in main/.
    If .webp is present, the app converts it to .png internally for the PDF.
    If conversion fails, the app will simply omit the logo (the PDF still works).

Troubleshooting

Blank page / “Could not find questions.json”
Make sure questions.json sits in the same folder as app.py (main/).

“AI disabled (fallback used)”
Add your key in Settings → Secrets and rerun; or set the OPENAI_API_KEY env var locally.

Unicode / weird characters in PDF
The app normalizes “curly” punctuation to ASCII so the built‑in PDF font won’t crash. If you want full Unicode, we can bundle a TTF and switch to add_font(..., uni=True).

Logo not showing
Ensure the file path is main/Life-Minus-Work-Logo.webp or main/logo.png. WebP conversion needs Pillow.
Editing questions

main/questions.json contains 15 questions, each with 4 choices and theme weights across: Identity, Growth, Connection, Peace, Adventure, Contribution. The app also offers a “✍️ I’ll write my own answer” option for every question and (if AI is enabled) lets the model nudge scores based on what the user writes.
Privacy & safety

    PDF is generated on the fly and offered as a download.
    A lightweight CSV is saved to /tmp/responses.csv in Cloud, which is ephemeral.
    No medical or clinical advice is provided; this is for reflection only.
